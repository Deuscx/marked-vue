The point of reference-style links is not that they’re easier to write. The point is that with reference-style links, your document source is vastly more readable. Compare the above examples: using reference-style links, the paragraph itself is only 81 characters long; with inline-style links, it’s 176 characters; and as raw \`HTML\`, it’s 234 characters. In the raw \`HTML\`, there’s more markup than there is text.
